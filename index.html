      <h2>My Programming Interests</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the main fields given above I had also had lots of
        interesting experience writing programs
        <strong>proving statistical statements</strong>, creating
        <strong>cryptographic comunication</strong> and even
        <strong>wrote my own compilator</strong> for pseudo-language, that
        translates given code to assembler, that can be processed by a vitual
        machine. At the course data bases i have learned crucial skills to
        become data scientist: <strong>MySql</strong>. In course of becoming a
        Machine Learning specialist I`m also taking the AI course.

      <h2>My interests beside programming</h2>
      <p>
        Beside programming I have lots of other interests. In my free time I
        sing, play guitar, draw and paint. My objective is to become a better
        version of myself everyday. I think that constant learning is the key
        to live life to the fullest. I like seeing new countries and cities
        even for a day or two. That kind of adventure allows to restart the
        brain. I also adore playing computer and console games. I like to think
        about the gaming mechanics, how and why were they created and implemented.
